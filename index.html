FR3D stands for &quot;Find RNA 3D&quot;.&nbsp; It was developed to find small RNA motifs 
(two to 20 nucleotides) in 
<a href="http://www.rcsb.org">PDB 
files</a>.&nbsp; It is available in two forms, as Matlab code that has been 
tested on the PC, Macintosh, and UNIX, 
and as a PC executable version that does not require a Matlab license.&nbsp; 
Releases, features, and known bugs are listed chronologically at the bottom of 
this page.&nbsp; <p align="center">

alt="Screen shot of the FR3D graphical user interface.  The query motif comes from the PDB file 1s72.  It consists of nucleotides 2701, 2702, 2703, 2691, 2693, and 2694.  The search to be conducted is a mixed geometric and symbolic search.  Candidate motifs must have the three indicated basepairs."

(29 MB, Matlab code, PC executable, PDB files) - <a href="FR3D_2007-03-19.zip">Matlab code</a> (747KB) -
<a href="FR3DEXE_2007-03-19.zip">PC Executable</a> (605KB)<p>

The starter package makes it easier for first-time users to download FR3D and 
start using it.&nbsp; A new option has been added to the Display Candidates 
menu, the ability to make scatterplots of the parameters describing pairs of 
nucleotides in the candidates.&nbsp; Known bugs:&nbsp; the alignment of 
candidates is sometimes incorrect; figure windows sometimes have incorrect 
names.<p>

<a href="FR3D-4-Analyzed-Files.zip">4 analyzed PDB files</a> (24MB)<p>

Substantial changes have been made.&nbsp; The basepairing criteria have been 
updated.&nbsp; FR3D now stores small versions of analyzed files to reduce memory 
usage and decrease startup time.&nbsp; The user can create lists of PDB files to 
more easily manage searches.&nbsp; Many additional symbolic constraints are 
allowed.&nbsp; The listing of candidates makes it easier to spot local and 
composite motifs, and to identify conserved features between candidates.&nbsp; 
Additional display features allow sorting candidates by centrality, grouping 
them into clusters, and showing an alignment of the nucleotides in the 
candidates.&nbsp; There is now a User's manual and other documentation.<p>

A PC executable version is now provided; see links above.&nbsp; Users may make and 
maintain lists of PDB files to search.&nbsp; To do so, make a text file called 
MyList_list.pdb with the name (no extension) of each PDB file on a separate 
line, then save it in the folder PDBFiles.&nbsp; Bugs noted in the previous release 
have been fixed. Bugs: 1. With the PC executable, you cannot copy the list of 
candidates found from the console window.&nbsp; 2. With the PC executable, you 
cannot &quot;View Query&quot; by checking the checkbox on the GUI.<hr>

A graphical user interface (GUI), written by Ali Mokdad, has been added.&nbsp; 
The program is more stable.&nbsp; Facilities have been added to mark candidates, 
to group them, to sort them by centrality to find a centroid, to produce a motif 
alignment, and to write them to a PDB file.&nbsp; NMR files are handled by 
spacing each version of the structure by 1000 Angstroms to prevent 
&quot;interactions&quot; between different copies of the same structure.&nbsp; Bugs:&nbsp; 
1. The 
query motif must be from the first chain in the file.&nbsp; 2. Only query motifs 
of 9 nucleotides or smaller can be used.<hr>
